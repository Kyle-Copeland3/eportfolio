Interactive computing:
 Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive environment that allows you to write and execute code, view the results, and visualize data in real-time. This makes it easy to experiment with different ideas and algorithms.

Easy to share:
 Notebooks are saved as structured text files (JSON format), which makes them easily shareable. You can share your work with others by sending them the notebook file or by hosting it on a public repository like GitHub.

Supports multiple programming languages:
 Jupyter Notebook supports multiple programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia. This makes it easy to work with different data sources and libraries.

Rich media support: 
 Jupyter Notebook supports rich media formats like HTML, LaTeX, and Markdown. This makes it easy to create interactive documents that combine code, text, and visualizations.

Great for showcasing your work: 
 Jupyter Notebook is great for showcasing your work. You can see both the code and the results in one place. This makes it easy to share your work with others and get feedback.

Easy to use other people's work as a starting point:
 You can use other people's work as a starting point for your own projects. You can run cell by cell to better understand what the code does.

Simple to host server-side: 
 Jupyter Notebook is very simple to host server-side, which is useful for security purposes.
